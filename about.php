            <h3>We are not an air freshening company</h3>
               <br>
            <p>A few decades ago, architects saw lighting as a luxury; now it has become a central aspect of spatial design. Scent will increasingly be used to draw out the sensual elements of public and private spaces. We realize the importance of an appropriate scent as an interior design element. Our experienced scent consulting team focuses on the right solution for each client.</p>
               <br>
            <p>Our goal is to link the emotions and memories that are burried deep in our olfactorial archive at a subliminal level, by the help of the most direct and powerful sense of smell and our perfectly captured scents.</p>
               <br>
            <p>"Marketers also love smell because it is the sense most directly linked to emotions", said Rachel Herz, a visiting professor specializing in olfactory cognition and emotions at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.</p>
